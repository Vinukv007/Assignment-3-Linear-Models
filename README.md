# Assignment-3-Linear-Models

1. House Rental Prediction.

Max Score: 100

Let's create a ML model to predict rent of house.
Here is the data - https://github.com/edyoda/data-science-complete-tutorial/blob/master/Data/house_rental_data.csv.txt
Make sure you do data wrangling & get useful insights/visualizations
Create models using Linear Regressions or variations of it
Think harder about data preprocessing



2. Employee Exit Prediction.

Max Score: 200

ML Model for predicting Employee Exit.
Data - https://github.com/edyoda/data-science-complete-tutorial/blob/master/Data/HR_comma_sep.csv.txt
Target Column - 'left' (0/1) represents exit or not
Data is heterogeneous in nature, so would need preprocessing before you feed them to ML models
Build a model to predict left column
Don't forget to spilt data in train & test subsets
Data Wrangling & insights graphs are always an important part of data science



3.Mobile Price Prediction.

Max Score: 100

Recently you entered in the mobile manufacturing market. Build a machine learning model that would help you to know the estimated price for your manufactured mobile phones on the basis of various key features and specifications.

4.Predict the price of an Airbnb listing.

Max Score: 100

Context
Airbnb, Inc. is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangements for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. Reference
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way.

Objective
Imagine you are Data Scientist who would help find the price for lodging or homestays based on different attributes mentioned in their 

listings. Oh wait, what are listings? Listings can include written descriptions, photographs with captions, and a user profile where potential guests can get to know a bit about the hosts.And you are given the listings of one of the most popular cities in central Europe: Amsterdam.

Now your job is to build a machine learning model that will automatically predict the price for lodging or homestays.
